#Introduction #

-> Welcome to the MerkelRex Application - a project developed as part of the "Object-Oriented Programming" specialization from Coursera, created during my 2nd Year of B.Tech. C.S.E. 

-> This application acts as a matching engine to facilitate trading operations using order books, with features to place bids, asks, and monitor wallet balances.

-> The purpose of this program is to:
   * Simulate the process of trading between assets, 
   * Offering users insights into how exchanges work by allowing them to place bids and asks
   * View the state of their virtual wallet over time.

#Menu Options Details #

Below is a detailed description of the menu options available in the program:

-> Help and Feedback (Option 1):
  * Displays this help guide along with the options to provide feedback. 
  * It contains instructions for using the application, including contact information for reporting issues.

-> Exchange Status (Option 2):
  * Prints the current status of the exchange, including information such as the latest bids, asks, and their respective prices. 
  * It gives an overview of the order book at the current timestamp.

-> Place Ask (Option 3):
  * Allows the user to place an "ask" — offering a certain amount of an asset at a particular price.
  * The ask will be matched with available bids if suitable ones exist, otherwise, it is added to the order book.

-> Place Bid (Option 4):
  * Enables the user to place a "bid" — requesting to buy a specific quantity of an asset at a defined price. 
  * This bid will either match with existing asks or remain pending until a corresponding ask appears.

-> Print Wallet (Option 5):
  * Prints the user's wallet, showing the current balance of all available assets. 
  * This function is crucial for tracking assets and cash balances.

-> Continue to Next Frame (Option 6):
  * Advances the simulation to the next frame or timestamp, updating the order book, executing any matching bids/asks, and reflecting changes in the user's wallet.

-> Exit (Option 7):
  * Exits the program. The user can exit at any time, but changes will not be saved.

If you select any option that is not on this list, you will be notified with a default message, and the menu will display again.

#Usage Examples #

Below are a few examples of how to interact with the program:

-> Example 1: Placing an Ask - When prompted to place an ask (option 3), you will be asked for the following:

Asset: BTC
Amount: 2
Price: 50000

This would place an ask to sell 2 BTC at the price of 50,000 units of the base currency.

-> Example 2: Continue to Next Frame - 
  * Selecting option 6 will move the exchange to the next timestamp. 
  * Any outstanding bids and asks will be processed, and your wallet will be updated based on the completed transactions.

#Error Handling #

While using the MerkelRex Application, you might encounter the following issues:

1. Invalid Input:
If you enter invalid data (e.g., text where numbers are expected), the program will prompt you to re-enter the correct information. Ensure to follow the prompts carefully to avoid errors.

2. Insufficient Funds:
When placing a bid, if your wallet doesn't have enough funds for the transaction, you will receive an error message. Check your wallet balance before placing bids or asks.

3. Order Not Matching:
If your bid or ask does not match any available counterpart in the order book, it will remain pending until a suitable match is found in future frames.

4. Unexpected Exits:
If you force close the application or encounter an unexpected shutdown, your progress will not be saved. Ensure to complete all transactions before exiting the program properly via option 7.
